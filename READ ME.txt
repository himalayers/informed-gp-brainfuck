The following are the files used in the system.
Legacy code referenced in the Development section of the accompanying Final Report has been removed.

Please use the Test.py script as an example of how to use the modules in this collection. It runs all algorithms:
	EDA, MEDA, IEDA, MIEDA, GP, MGP, IGP, MIGP, RS, US
on a specific target word-program.

To view the DATA files that I collected, run datadefinition and choose the file to view. The format of the files is:
fitnessevaluations_ - number of fitness evaluations algs. were run for.
maxprogsize_ - maximum program size allowed in all algs.
sizerange_ - range of sizes of words in models
nrange_ - range of n values in models
algorithmsincluded_ - algorithms data was gathered for, 1=gathered, 0=not, for [mieda, migp, rs, meda, mgp, us]
seen/unseen - whether seen or unseen words by model were used

Please also note that some non-built-in imports may be required:
Matplotlib
Numpy
